# musictag

Simplify the process of downloading and then processing music covers from YouTube with Musictag. Uses the [https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl](yt-dl) library to download tracks from YouTube.
Musictag automatically processes and finds the best metadata for your current song, supported by music libraries such as [https://holodex.stoplight.io/](Holo-dex) with plans to expand to other libraries like [https://musicbrainz.org/](Musicbrainz) or [https://www.last.fm/api](last.fm).
Inspired by the automagical tagging system of self-hosted media servers like Plex or Jellyfin
