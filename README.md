# Musictag

Simplify the process of downloading and then processing music covers from YouTube with Musictag. Uses the [yt-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) library to download tracks from YouTube.
Musictag automatically processes and finds the best metadata for your current song, supported by music libraries such as [Holo-dex](https://holodex.stoplight.io/) with plans to expand to other libraries like [Musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) or [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api).
Inspired by the automagical tagging system of self-hosted media servers like Plex or Jellyfin
